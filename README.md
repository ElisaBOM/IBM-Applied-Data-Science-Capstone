# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
In this repository you'll find various files from the hands on labs, divided by module (1-5), from the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate as well as the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization. This is the 10th course (out of 12) I'm taking on the proffessional path offered by FUNDAE in Coursera. This capstone project course gives the chance to practice the work that data scientists do in real life when working with datasets.   
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 
## Module 1- Introduction 
provides an overview of the problem and the tools you need to complete the course.
## Module 2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
In this module data on the Falcon 9 first-stage landings is collected. We use a RESTful API and web scraping. Also convert the data into a dataframe and then perform some data wrangling.
### Learning Objectives 
* Create scatter plots and bar charts by writing Python code to analyze data in a Pandas data frame
* Write Python code to conduct exploratory data analysis by manipulating data in a Pandas data frame
* Create and execute SQL queries to select and sort data
* Utilize your data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process
## Module 3- Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboards 
In this module, we build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash. Afterwards, build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
### Learning Objectives 
* Build an interactive dashboard that contains pie charts and scatter plots to analyze data with the Plotly Dash Python library.
* Calculate distances on an interactive map by writing Python code using the Folium library.
* Generate interactive maps, plot coordinates, and mark clusters by writing Python code using the Folium library.
* Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
* Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
## Module 4- Predicted Analysis (Classification) 
In this module, we use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. You will split your data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then find the method that performs best using test data.
### Learning Objectives 
* Split the data into training testing data
* Train different classification models
* Optimize the Hyperparameter grid search
* Utilize your machine learning skills to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently
## Module 5- Present Your Data-Driven Insights 
In this module, we compile all of your activities into one place and deliver your data-driven insights to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully.
### Learning Objectives 
* Establish how to structure and build your data-findings report.
* Evaluate the final assignment using AI-mark based grading or peer grading
